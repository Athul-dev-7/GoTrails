    *   Why Go ?   
        -   Go was designed to run on multiple cores and built to support concurrency.
        -   Concurrency on Go is cheap and Easy.
    *	Map's can't have mixed data types.
    	-	var myMap = make(map[string]string)	
    *	Struct can have mixed data types.
    	-	"type" keyword is using because we are defining a custom data type.
    	-	type UserData struct {
    			firstName string
    			lastName string
    			email string
    			numberOfTickets uint
    			isMale bool
    		}
    		var bookings = make([]UserData,0)
